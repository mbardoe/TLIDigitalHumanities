# TLI on Digital Humanities

This course introduces participants (who need no prior experience in computer programming) to the world of digital humanities, which involves the application of computational tools to the interpretation of texts on any topic.  We seek to pose questions that only digital technologies can easily answer, questions like “Whether it is a novel, a scientific article or a primary historical document, what are a given text’s most commonly-used words and what does such a list reveal about the text?  What can a mapping of paragraph or sentence lengths in a text tell us about an author’s conscious or unconscious narrative and rhetorical strengths?  What do authors’ favorite punctuation marks say about their writing and how do these generate different effects on the reader?”  Together participants generate additional questions and attempt to use digital technologies to answer them.  In addition, participants apply digital tools to their own writing to analyze their own habits of thinking and expression in a new light.  Finally, we explore tools of data visualization for effect presentation of discoveries enabled by the tools of digital humanities.
