### Plotting Term Frequencies across multiple texts with R
This repository contains a utility for visualizing the distribution of one or more terms over the course of multiple texts in R. 

#### R
The R script in this directory uses the ggplot2 library to visualize the distribution of one or more keywords of interest over the course of multiple texts. This plot allows you to assign a different color to each word grouping, where a word grouping may contain one or more words. By running this script, you can see how widely used one or more keywords are within multiple texts of interest. The plot generated by the plot looks like this:  

![ggplot of term frequency]
(./plot/multiple_greek_words_multiple_texts_plot.png)

To run the R script, open RStudio, install ggplot2 and the XML libraries if necessary, set the working directory to the `data` directory contained in this directory, and run each command in the file. To run a command, you can hold the Control (Windows) or Command (OSX) button while pressing Return.
